## ONVIF Discussion Forum

With the closure of the ONVIF Member Forum, this repository's [discussion tab](https://github.com/onvif/testspecs/discussions) is available as a replacement. Questions regarding the test specifications and the ONVIF test tool (available to ONVIF Members) should be asked there.

General questions regarding ONVIF may also be asked at Stack Overflow, using the [ONVIF tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/onvif)
