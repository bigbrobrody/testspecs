      The goal of the ONVIF Test Specification set is to make it possible to realize fully
      interoperable IP physical security implementations from different vendors. This
      specification also acts as an input document to the development of a test tool which
      will be used to test the ONVIF Client implementation conformance towards ONVIF standard.
      This Client Test Tool analyzes network communications between ONVIF Devices and Clients
      being tested and determines whether a specific Client is ONVIF conformant (see ONVIF
      Conformance Process Specification).
